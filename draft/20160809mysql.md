# Mysql查询

[Speed of SELECT Statements](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select-speed.html)

1. 合理利用索引
2. 隔离调试查询中花费高的部分，例如函数调用是在结果集中的行执行还是全表中的行执行
3. 最小化全表扫描的数量，特别是在大的表里面 

4. 定期使用ANALYZE TABLE语句更新表的统计数据，使查询优化器可以做出更合理的优化。

5. 学习各个存储引擎的特殊调试，索引和配置。
6. 优化单条只读查询的事务。
7. 避免使用难以理解的方式便携query
8. 如果性能问题不能通过基本的guidelines解决，那么使用explan语句查看更具体的信息
9. 调整MySQL所使用到的用作缓存的内存区域，例如(InnoDB buffer pool, MyISAM key cache, MySQL query cache)
10.小心处理锁的问题 


# buffer pool
buffer pool 是Mysql中用来存放InnoDB的表和索引数据的内存区域， 这些内存区域被划分成页。buffer pool使用使用linked list作为pages的实现。页的交换使用LRU算法，在大内存的系统中，你可以将buffer pool划分成多个buffer pool instances。 innodb_buffer_pool_size中配置的内存大小被所有buffer pool实例所分割，多buffer pool实例更适给Innodb buffer pool划分几个G以上空间的应用，每一个实例都可以得到一个1G或者以上大小的空间。































### Block Quote

> Angle brackets `>` are used for block quotes.  
Technically not every line needs to start with a `>` as long as
there are no empty lines between paragraphs.  
> Looks kinda ugly though.
> > Block quotes can be nested.  
> > > Multiple Levels
>
> Most markdown syntaxes work inside block quotes.
>
> * Lists
> * [Links][arbitrary_id]
> * Etc.

Here is the code:

```
> Angle brackets `>` are used for block quotes.  
Technically not every line needs to start with a `>` as long as
there are no empty lines between paragraphs.  
> Looks kinda ugly though.
> > Block quotes can be nested.  
> > > Multiple Levels
>
> Most markdown syntaxes work inside block quotes.
>
> * Lists
> * [Links][arbitrary_id]
> * Etc.
```
  
  
### Inline Code
`Inline code` is indicated by surrounding it with backticks:  
`` `Inline code` ``

If your ``code has `backticks` `` that need to be displayed, you can use double backticks:  
```` ``Code with `backticks` `` ````  (mind the spaces preceding the final set of backticks)


### Block Code
If you indent at least four spaces or one tab, I'll display a code block.

	print('This is a code block')
	print('The block must be preceded by a blank line')
	print('Then indent at least 4 spaces or 1 tab')
		print('Nesting does nothing. Your code is displayed Literally')

I also know how to do something called [Fenced Code Blocks](#fenced-code-block) which I will tell you about later.

### Horizontal Rules
If you type three asterisks `***` or three dashes `---` on a line, I'll display a horizontal rule:

***

### Document Formatting
The ***Smartypants*** extension automatically transforms straight quotes (`"` and `'`) in your text into typographer’s quotes (`“`, `”`, `‘`, and `’`) according to the context. Very useful if you’re a typography freak like I am. Quote and Smartypants are syntactically incompatible. If both are enabled, Quote takes precedence.


### Block Formatting

#### Table

This is a table:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

You can align cell contents with syntax like this:

| Left Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text |         $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |           $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |            $1 |

The left- and right-most pipes (`|`) are only aesthetic, and can be omitted. The spaces don’t matter, either. Alignment depends solely on `:` marks.

#### <a name="fenced-code-block">Fenced Code Block</a>

This is a fenced code block:

```
print('Hello world!')
```

You can also use waves (`~`) instead of back ticks (`` ` ``):

~~~
print('Hello world!')
~~~


You can add an optional language ID at the end of the first line. The language ID will only be used to highlight the code inside if you tick the ***Enable highlighting in code blocks*** option. This is what happens if you enable it:

![Syntax highlighting example](http://d.pr/i/9HM6+)

I support many popular languages as well as some generic syntax descriptions that can be used if your language of choice is not supported. See [relevant sections on the official site](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/features/) for a full list of supported syntaxes.


### Inline Formatting

The following is a list of optional inline markups supported:

Option name         | Markup           | Result if enabled     |
--------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
Intra-word emphasis | So A\*maz\*ing   | So A<em>maz</em>ing   |
Strikethrough       | \~~Much wow\~~   | <del>Much wow</del>   |
Underline [^under]  | \_So doge\_      | <u>So doge</u>        |
Quote [^quote]      | \"Such editor\"  | <q>Such editor</q>    |
Highlight           | \==So good\==    | <mark>So good</mark>  |
Superscript         | hoge\^(fuga)     | hoge<sup>fuga</sup>   |
Autolink            | http://t.co      | <http://t.co>         |
Footnotes           | [\^4] and [\^4]: | [^4] and footnote 4   |

[^4]: You don't have to use a number. Arbitrary things like `[^footy note4]` and `[^footy note4]:` will also work. But they will *render* as numbered footnotes. Also, no need to keep your footnotes in order, I will sort out the order for you so they appear in the same order they were referenced in the text body. You can even keep some footnotes near where you referenced them, and collect others at the bottom of the file in the traditional place for footnotes. 




## <a name="rendering-pane"></a>The Rendering Preference Pane
This is where I keep preferences relating to how I render and style the parsed markdown in the preview window.  
![Rendering preferences pane](http://d.pr/i/rT4d+)

### CSS
You can choose different css files for me to use to render your html. You can even customize or add your own custom css files.

### Syntax Highlighting
You have already seen how I can syntax highlight your fenced code blocks. See the [Fenced Code Block](#fenced-code-block) section if you haven’t! You can also choose different themes for syntax highlighting.

### TeX-like Math Syntax
I can also render TeX-like math syntaxes, if you allow me to.[^math] I can do inline math like this: \\( 1 + 1 \\) or this (in MathML): <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></math>, and block math:

\\[
    A^T_S = B
\\]

or (in MathML)

<math display="block">
    <msubsup><mi>A</mi> <mi>S</mi> <mi>T</mi></msubsup>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <mi>B</mi>
</math>



### Task List Syntax
1. [x] I can render checkbox list syntax
	* [x] I support nesting
	* [x] I support ordered *and* unordered lists
2. [ ] I don't support clicking checkboxes directly in the html window


### Jekyll front-matter
If you like, I can display Jekyll front-matter in a nice table. Just make sure you put the front-matter at the very beginning of the file, and fence it with `---`. For example:

```
---
title: "Macdown is my friend"
date: 2014-06-06 20:00:00
---
```

### Render newline literally
Normally I require you to put two spaces and a newline (aka return) at the end of a line in order to create a line break. If you like, I can render a newline any time you end a line with a newline. However, if you enable this, markdown that looks lovely when I render it might look pretty funky when you let some *other* program render it.





## <a name="general-pane"></a>The General Preferences Pane

This is where I keep preferences related to application behavior.  
![General preferences pane](http://d.pr/i/rvwu+)

The General Preferences Pane allows you to tell me how you want me to behave. For example, do you want me to make sure there is a document open when I launch? You can also tell me if I should constantly update the preview window as you type, or wait for you to hit `command-R` instead. Maybe you prefer your editor window on the right? Or to see the word-count as you type. This is also the place to tell me if you are interested in pre-releases of me, or just want to stick to better-tested official releases.  

## <a name="editor-pane"></a>The Editor Preference Pane
This is where I keep preferences related to the behavior and styling of the editing window.  
![Editor preferences pane](http://d.pr/i/6OL5+)


### Styling

My editor provides syntax highlighting. You can edit the base font and the coloring/sizing theme. I provided some default themes (courtesy of [Mou](http://mouapp.com)’s creator, Chen Luo) if you don’t know where to start.

You can also edit, or even add new themes if you want to! Just click the ***Reveal*** button, and start moving things around. Remember to use the correct file extension (`.styles`), though. I’m picky about that.

I offer auto-completion and other functions to ease your editing experience. If you don’t like it, however, you can turn them off.





## Hack On

That’s about it. Thanks for listening. I’ll be quiet from now on (unless there’s an update about the app—I’ll remind you for that!).

Happy writing!


[^emphasize]: If **Underlines** is turned on, `_this notation_` will render as underlined instead of emphasized 

[^under]: If **Underline** is disabled `_this_` will be rendered as *emphasized* instead of being underlined.

[^quote]: **Quote** replaces literal `"` characters with html `<q>` tags. **Quote** and **Smartypants** are syntactically incompatible. If both are enabled, **Quote** takes precedence. Note that **Quote** is different from *blockquote*, which is part of standard Markdown.

[^math]: Internet connection required.
